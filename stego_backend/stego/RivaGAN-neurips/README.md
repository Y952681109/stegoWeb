This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for robust video watermarking. Using 
multiple adversarial networks which can emulate non-differentiable objectives, we are able 
to achieve state-of-the-results in video watermarking by producing watermarked videos which 
have minimal visual distortion and are robust against attacks including blurring, compression, 
re-recording, and even machine learning based watermark removal tools.
